    <p>I have always loved to travel. In my 18 years of life I have made it to 32 of the 50 states, and 2 countries. <em>The world is beautiful.</em> In all my travels, my favorite place has been <strong>Antelope Canyon</strong> in Arizona.The Canyon is full of life, character, color, and wonderful views. Whether you are a solo traveler, or have a family of 10 this destination is perfect for eveyone. I mean just look at those views. </p>

    <H3>Personal Experience</H3>
    <p>My family has always loved to go on roadtrips. Having a house in Arizona, it only made sense for us to take a pit stop at Antelope Canyon during our yearly maintenance visit. I have always seen beautiful pictures of the Canyon, and pushed them off with the excuse that they were highly edited. When arriving at the Canyon we didn't see alot. Makes sense, it is a Canyon. To see the true beauty you have to hike into it. I was not disappointed. The color and character of the walls amazed me. Carved by periodic rains, this canyon is an absolute work of art. I will forever love this destination and cannot wait to go back. The character and color in the walls is unlike anything I have seen before. </p>
