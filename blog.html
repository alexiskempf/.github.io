        <p>Hi again, Alexis here. Life has been crazy. Although I wanted to drop out the first week of college, I am doing pretty good. Business has been crazy. I go home alot for the purpose of packing orders and making new pairs. Wholesale orders, to individuals I have it all. I am very thankful for what life has thrown it at me. </p>
